## üìñ Description

The **Alembic Migration Checker** GitHub Action performs a comprehensive check of the database schema by comparing
the Alembic version of the latest migration script with the current state of the database. It identifies and alerts
users to any discrepancies or potential issues between the applied database migration and the latest migration script
available in the Alembic migrations directory. This proactive approach helps prevent migration conflicts and
inconsistencies, ensuring a smooth deployment pipeline. By integrating this action into GitHub workflows,
teams can maintain a consistent and accurate reflection of their database migrations, facilitating smoother and
more reliable application deployments, particularly in CI/CD environments.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Inputs

This action supports various inputs to accommodate different database configurations.

_Note that some inputs are not required for all database types, such as SQLite._

- `db_url`: The url of database to check. Alternative to `db_host`, `db_port`, `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_name`.
- `db_type`: The database type. Supported values are `postgresql`, `mysql`, and `sqlite`. Default: `postgresql`.
- `db_host`: The database host address.
- `db_port`: The database port. Defaults to `5432`.
- `db_user`: The username for database access.
- `db_password`: The password for database access.
- `db_name`: The name of the database to check.
- `migrations_path`: The path to your Alembic migrations folder. Defaults to `./migrations/`.

### üö¶ Exit Status

- **Exit Code 0**: This code indicates successful execution of the action. It can signify one of two scenarios:
    1. No new migrations were detected, and the database schema is fully aligned with the latest migration script.
    2. One or more new migrations were detected, but the database schema is already aligned with the latest migration
       script. In other words, the down revisions of the database match those of the migration scripts, ensuring
       consistency.

- **Exit Code 1**: This code indicates errors or discrepancies encountered during execution. It typically signifies
  that:
    - The database schema does not align with the migration history, indicating potential issues such as missing or
      mismatched migrations. This could require further investigation and corrective action to ensure database
      consistency.

## üõ† Usage

Below are usage examples on how to use the Alembic Migration Checker for different types of supported databases within
your GitHub Actions workflows.

### üêò PostgreSQL Example

Please note that `db_type` is by default `postgresql`. So, for this type of database it is not necessary to specify it.
Also, `db_port` is by default `5432`, specify the `db_port` only if you use a different one.

```yaml
- name: Check Alembic Migration Version
  uses: DevGlitch/alembic-migration-checker@v1
  with:
    db_url: ${{ secrets.DB_URL }}
    # or specify individual parameters
    db_host: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
    db_port: ${{ secrets.DB_PORT }}  # Only if not using 5432 default port
    db_user: ${{ secrets.DB_USER }}
    db_password: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
    db_name: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }}
    migrations_path: ./migrations/
```

### üê¨ MySQL

When working with MySQL, change the `db_type` to `mysql`. This example includes all necessary parameters for a MySQL
database connection.

```yaml
- name: Check Alembic Migration Version
  uses: DevGlitch/alembic-migration-checker@v1
  with:
    db_url: ${{ secrets.DB_URL }}
    # or specify individual parameters
    db_type: mysql
    db_host: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
    db_port: ${{ secrets.DB_PORT }}
    db_user: ${{ secrets.DB_USER }}
    db_password: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
    db_name: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }}
    migrations_path: ./migrations/
```

### ü™∂ SQLite

For SQLite databases, change the `db_type` to `sqlite`. The configuration is simplified
as `db_host`, `db_port`, `db_user`, and `db_password` are not needed.

```yaml
- name: Check Alembic Migration Version
  uses: DevGlitch/alembic-migration-checker@v1
  with:
    db_type: sqlite
    db_name: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }}
    migrations_path: ./migrations/
```

Ensure that your workflow is correctly set up to use these configurations, adjusting parameters as necessary for your
specific database setup.

## üí° Recommended Use Cases

The **Alembic Migration Checker** GitHub Action is a versatile tool designed to enhance your CI/CD pipeline by providing
essential checks at critical stages of development and deployment. Below are detailed examples of how to integrate this
action into workflows for pull requests and deployments, ensuring database migrations are always synchronized with your
application's expected state.

### üîÄ Pull Requests (PRs)

Integrating the Alembic Migration Checker into the PR review process ensures compatibility between new migrations and
the
existing database schema. This proactive measure helps prevent migration conflicts from affecting the main branch,
promoting stability throughout the development lifecycle.

Here's an example workflow for pull requests:

```yaml
name: Alembic Migration Check on PR

on: pull_request

jobs:
  check-migration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Check Alembic Migration Version
        uses: DevGlitch/alembic-migration-checker@v1
        with:
          db_host: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
          db_name: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }}
          # Specify other necessary inputs...
```

### üöÄ Deployment Workflows

Before proceeding with deployments to staging or production, employing the Alembic Migration Checker ensures the
database
schema aligns with the repository's migration scripts. This validation lays a solid foundation for application
deployments, mitigating risks associated with schema discrepancies.

An example workflow for deployment might look like this:

```yaml
name: Pre-deployment Alembic Migration Check

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pre-deploy-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Check Alembic Migration Version
        uses: DevGlitch/alembic-migration-checker@v1
        with:
          db_host: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DB_HOST }}
          db_name: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DB_NAME }}
          # Include additional inputs as needed...
```

By incorporating the Alembic Migration Checker into these critical workflow stages, teams can significantly enhance the
reliability of their development and deployment processes. This action serves as a safeguard, ensuring that the database
schema is consistently in sync with the application's migration history, thereby facilitating smoother and more
dependable application releases.
